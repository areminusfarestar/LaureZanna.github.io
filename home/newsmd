**Sep 2018:** TICTOC annual meeting in Oxford, Sep 25-26 

**Aug 2018:**

- Our new [paper](https://laurezanna.github.io/files/pdf/zanna-al-revised-july1-2018.pdf) on "Uncertainty and Scale Interactions in Ocean Ensembles" was accepted in QJRMS

- Congrats to [Tomos David](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/david) who just completed his PhD with us, and for his latest [paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/aad19a/meta) in J. of Stat Mech on eddy-mixing entropy in forced-dissipative geostrophic turbulence

**Jul 2018:** Some of us will be attending the international [US-AMOC](https://usclivar.org/meetings/2018-amoc-rapid-meeting) meeting, I will talk about "AMOC in a changing climate: yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery"  

**Jun 2018:** Two accepted papers led by [Chris O'Reilly](https://sites.google.com/site/christopherhorkesley/): One [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL079077) on contrasting oceanic processes influencing decadal extratropical SST anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and [another](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0451.1) on the influence of tropical precipitation on summertime circulation anomalies in the Atlantic sector

**May 2018:** New PhD student [Matthias Aengenheyster](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/students/matthias-aengenheyster/) is joining our group and current PhD student [Tom Bolton](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/students/tom-bolton/) wins the Werrett Prize for the best 2nd year DPhil/PhD report

**Apr 2018:** A paper led by Scott Bachman (NCAR) on the mathematics and physics of non-Newtonian fluids as a representation of ocean turbulence was accepted in Ocean Modelling

**Mar 2018:** PhD work by [Ben Bronselaer](https://bronselaer.wordpress.com/) highlighted on the [MITgcm blog](http://mitgcm.org/2018/03/08/exploring-the-southern-ocean-pco2-wind-stress-connection/)

**Feb 2018:** Our group is attending [Ocean Sciences](https://osm.AGU.org/2018/) and will present work on: "Air-sea coupling and predictability of North Atlantic Ocean variability",  "Passive heat uptake and high-latitude feedbacks", and "Interannual Variability of Mixing in the Gulf Stream"

**Jan 2018:** Our new website is live (though the research sections need more work)
