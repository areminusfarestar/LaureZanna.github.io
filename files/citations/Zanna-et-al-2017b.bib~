In this work, we attempt to 1) extend global estimates of ocean
warming before 1950s; 2) infer how changes in ocean circulation can
shape patterns of ocean warming and sea level.

We created a model based on a technique which maps information between
the surface of the ocean and its interior. The model is informed by a
combination of observations and computer simulations.

Our findings suggest that 1) the ocean has gained energy equivalent to
roughly 436 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ Joules from 1871 to present, and that
2) changes in ocean processes (currents + mixing) have occured in the
past 60 yrs affecting regional sea level rise in the Atlantic Oceean.
While we have identified changes in ocean tranport in the past 60
years, we cannot directly attribute the changes to natural variability
or externally-forced climate change.

Our method is obviously subject to uncertainty from many different
sources (described in detail in the manuscript). However our results
are consistent with direct interior temperature measurements giving us
some confidence in the method.

Much work remains to be done to understand observed and predicted
patterns of oceaen warming and thermosteric sea level rise, which our
method can hopefully help address.
