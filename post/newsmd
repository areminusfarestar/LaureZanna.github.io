**Jan 2019:**  Welcome to Emily Newsom 

Emily is joining our group from Caltech as part of [TICTOC](http://projects.noc.ac.uk/tictoc/).  



**Dec 2018:** Wadham news story on our work

- A little story on our work on ocean and climate, including our new
 ideas using machine learning, published on the [Wadham website](https://www.wadham.ox.ac.uk/news/2018/december/upgrading-climate-predictions-with-ai)
 
**Nov 2018:** Ocean heat content from 1871:

- Our new paper on reconstruction ocean heat content from 1871 to
  present was accepted in PNAS. The paper was part of our exciting
  NERC Large Grant [TICTOC](http://projects.noc.ac.uk/tictoc/).  Stay
  tuned for more info.


**Oct 2018:** New team members:

- Alex Todd will join as part of the project: Adressing the grand
  challenge of regional sea level prediction [UK
  FAFMIP](http://www.fafmip.org/)", co-led with Jonathan Gregory

- Mike Byrne will join us a Marie Curie Fellow working on monsoons
  dynamics under climate change.

**Sep 2018:** The annual meeting of our project "Transient
  tracer-based Investigation of Circulation and Thermal Ocean Change"
  [TICTOC](http://projects.noc.ac.uk/tictoc/) will be held in Oxford
  on Sep 25-26

**Aug 2018:**

- Our new
  [paper](https://laurezanna.github.io/files/pdf/zanna-al-revised-july1-2018.pdf)
  on "Uncertainty and Scale Interactions in Ocean Ensembles" was
  accepted in QJRMS

- Congrats to [Tomos
  David](https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/contacts/people/david) who just
  completed his PhD with us, and for his latest
  [paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/aad19a/meta)
  in J. of Stat Mech on eddy-mixing entropy in forced-dissipative
  geostrophic turbulence

**Jul 2018:** Some of us will be attending the international
  [US-AMOC](https://usclivar.org/meetings/2018-amoc-rapid-meeting)
  meeting, I will talk about "AMOC in a changing climate: yesterday is
  history, tomorrow is a mystery"

**Jun 2018:** Two accepted papers led by [Chris
  O'Reilly](https://sites.google.com/site/christopherhorkesley/): One
  [paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GL079077)
  on contrasting oceanic processes influencing decadal extratropical
  SST anomalies in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and
  [another](https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0451.1)
  on the influence of tropical precipitation on summertime circulation
  anomalies in the Atlantic sector

**May 2018:** New PhD student [Matthias
  Aengenheyster](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/students/matthias-aengenheyster/)
  is joining our group and current PhD student [Tom
  Bolton](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/students/tom-bolton/)
  wins the Werrett Prize for the best 2nd year DPhil/PhD report

**Apr 2018:** A paper led by Scott Bachman (NCAR) on the mathematics
  and physics of non-Newtonian fluids as a representation of ocean
  turbulence was accepted in Ocean Modelling

**Mar 2018:** PhD work by [Ben
  Bronselaer](https://bronselaer.wordpress.com/) highlighted on the
  [MITgcm
  blog](http://mitgcm.org/2018/03/08/exploring-the-southern-ocean-pco2-wind-stress-connection/)

**Feb 2018:** Our group is attending [Ocean
  Sciences](https://osm.AGU.org/2018/) and will present work on:
  "Air-sea coupling and predictability of North Atlantic Ocean
  variability", "Passive heat uptake and high-latitude feedbacks", and
  "Interannual Variability of Mixing in the Gulf Stream"

**Jan 2018:** Our new website is live (though the research sections
  need more work)
