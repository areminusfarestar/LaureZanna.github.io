      <title>Global reconstruction of historical ocean heat storage and transport</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the excess energy stored in the climate system due
to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions has been taken up by the
oceans, leading to thermal expansion and sea level rise.  The oceans
thus have an important role in the Earth&amp;rsquo;s energy imbalance.
Observational constraints on future anthropogenic warming critically
depend on accurate estimates of past ocean heat content (OHC)
change. We present a novel reconstruction of OHC since 1871, with
global coverage of the full ocean depth. Our estimates combine
timeseries of observed sea surface temperatures, with much longer
historical coverage than those in the ocean interior, together with a
representation (a Green&amp;rsquo;s function) of time-independent ocean
transport processes.  For 1955-2017, our estimates are comparable to
direct estimates made by infilling the available 3D time-dependent
ocean temperature observations. We find that the global ocean absorbed
heat during this period at a rate of 0.30 $\pm$ 0.06 W/m$^2$ in the
upper 2000 m and 0.028 $\pm$ 0.026 W/m$^2$ below 2000 m, with large
decadal fluctuations. The total OHC change since 1871 is estimated at
436 $\pm$91 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ J, with an increase during 1921-1946
(145 $\pm$ 62$\times$ 10$^{21}$ J) that is as large as during
1990-2015. By comparing with direct estimates, we also infer that,
during 1955-2017, up to half of the Atlantic Ocean warming and
thermosteric sea level rise at low-to-mid latitudes emerged due to
heat convergence from changes in ocean transport.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Applications of Deep Learning to Ocean Data Inference and Sub-Grid Parameterisation</title>
      <link>https://LaureZanna.github.io/publication/bolton-zanna-2018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oceanographic observations are limited by sampling rates,
while ocean models are limited by finite resolution and high viscosity
and diffusion coefficients. Therefore both data from observations and
ocean models lack information at small-scales. Methods are needed to
either extract information, extrapolate, or up-scale existing
oceanographic datasets, to account for the unresolved physical
processes. Here we use machine learning to leverage observations and
model data by predicting unresolved turbulent processes and
sub-surface flow fields. As a proof-of-concept, we train convolutional
neural networks on degraded-data from a high-resolution
quasi-geostrophic ocean model. We demonstrate that convolutional
neural networks successfully replicate the spatio-temporal variability
of the sub-grid eddy momentum forcing, are capable of generalising to
a range of dynamical behaviours, and can be forced to respect global
momentum conservation. The training data of our convolutional neural
networks can be sub-sampled to 10-20% of the original size without a
significant increase in accuracy. We also show that the sub-surface
flow field can be predicted using only information at the surface,
mimicing when only satellite altimetry data is available. Our study
indicates that data-driven approaches can be exploited while
respecting physical principles, even when data is limited to a
particular region or external forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The signature of oceanic processes on extratropical decadal SST anomalies</title>
      <link>https://LaureZanna.github.io/publication/oreilly-zanna-2018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The relationship between decadal sea surface temperature (SST) and
turbulent heat fluxes is assessed and used to identify where oceanic
processes play an important role in extratropical decadal SST
variability. In observational data sets and coupled climate model
simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
archive, positive correlations between upward turbulent heat flux and
SSTs indicate an active role of oceanic processes over regions in the
North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, Southern Pacific, and Southern
Atlantic. The contrasting nature of oceanic influence on decadal SST
anomalies in the Northwest Pacific and North Atlantic is
identified. Over the Northwest Pacific, SST anomalies are consistent
with changes in the horizontal wind-driven gyre circulation on
timescales of between 3 and 7 years, in both the observations and
models. Over the North Atlantic, SST anomalies are also preceded by
atmospheric circulation anomalies, though the response is stronger at
longer timescalesâ€”peaking at around 20 years in the observations and
at around 10 years in the models.&lt;/p&gt;
