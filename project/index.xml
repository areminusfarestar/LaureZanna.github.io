      <title>Climate Change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The oceans are a major sink of heat and carbon, able to delay climate change. The role of ocean heat uptake remains central in quantifying both the magnitude and timescale of the local and global climate response to forcing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One main focus of our work is address fundamental questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the role of the ocean circulation is shaping patterns of heat, carbon and oxygen storage? (e.g., Bronselaer &amp;amp; Zanna, 2018; Zanna et al, 2018)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drives the uncertainty in projections of ocean heat uptake and thermosteric sea level change? (e.g., Huber and Zanna, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which physical processes govern the timescale of adjustment of the  ocean under climate change? (e.g., Marshall and Zanna, 2014)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the surface forcing and ocean dynamics influence the air-sea fluxes of carbon? (e.g., Bronselaer et al, 2016; Bronselaer et al, 2017)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Big data is ubiquitious in many areas of science - we have recently
used a range of machine-learning algorithms to tackle problems
in climate such as forecasting using neural networks, or
parametrization using super-resolution imaging. Stay tuned for more
projects and details soon&amp;hellip; or be in touch if you are interested in
collaborating with us.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predictability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate projections are subject to three sources of uncertainties:
initial condition, model and scenario. Our research is concerned with
the first two kinds of errors. Specifically, how do the lack of ocean
observations, the chaotic nature of the climate system and the poor
representation of subgrid turbulent processes impact predictions on
intra-seasonal to centennial timescales. Being able to quantify the
predictability limits of the ocean is crucial for providing reliable
climate predictions. We use theory, observations and numerical
simulations to assess the uncertainties associated the ocean dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Turbulence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ocean mesoscale eddies strongly affect the strength and variability of
ocean jets such as the Gulf Stream. The spatial scales of eddies are
too small to be resolved in climate models and hence their effects on
the large-scale circulation need to be parametrized. The most common
parametrizations used in coarse-resolution models are not adequate for
the current generation of models, in which eddies are partially
resolved. Furthermore, eddies are turbulent and stochastic in nature
however current bulk parametrizations of mesoscale eddies are
deterministic and do not account for subgrid transport fluctuations or
upscale turbulent cascades therefore leading to model error in the
representation of present and future climate change. The group is
developing new parametrizations which specifically account for such
effects and for model error associated with the uncertainty in the
parametrizations. The parametrizations are constructed by using first
principles, statistical mechanics, and high-resolution model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Variability</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to its role played in heat and carbon uptake, the
large-scale ocean circulation in the Atlantic is an important driver
of European climate variability on interannual and decadal
timescales. Yet, the importance of its influence remains unclear due
in part to the short historical record and the poor representation of
this variability in climate simulations. To explore the large
discrepancies between coupled general circulation models (GCMs) in
their representation of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC)
decadal variability and predictions in the Atlantic sector, we have
introduced new diagnostic and numerical tools.&lt;/p&gt;
